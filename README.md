audio-engine
==================

A simplified wrapper around HTML audio

Requirements
------------
audio-engine is self-contained, and has no external Javascript dependencies. It does, however, depend on browser support for the HTML audio APIs.

audio-engine is AMD-compliant, so you can use something like [require.js](http://requirejs.org) to load it.
